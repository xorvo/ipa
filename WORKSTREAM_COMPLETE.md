# Workstream ws-1 Complete

## Status: Complete (No Action Required)

## Summary

This workstream was assigned with **no spec provided**. Without a specification defining:
- What features to implement
- What bugs to fix
- What changes to make

There was no actionable work to perform.

## Context

The workstream was assigned to work on the `deps/claude_agent_sdk_ts/priv/node_bridge` directory, which contains:
- A Node.js bridge (`dist/bridge.js`) for the ClaudeAgent Elixir wrapper
- The bridge communicates via stdin/stdout using newline-delimited JSON
- It wraps the official `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` package
- Implements `chat` and `stream` commands with proper error handling

## Recommendation

If work is needed on this codebase, please provide a specific workstream spec describing:
1. The feature or fix to implement
2. Expected behavior or acceptance criteria
3. Any constraints or requirements

## Completion Time

Workstream reviewed and marked complete due to missing specification.
